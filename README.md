# poe part 1 README file

- this is a simple cybersecurity awareness bot that uses console interactive appplication to communicate with the user.

# project details
- project name: poe_part1_prog
- natefame:4.7.2
- templete: console App (.Net framework)

# Main class 

### what does it contain?
- instance classes
--
### how does it work?
- the main pclas initialize the instance of a voice_message, logo_image and filter_questions class.
- it desplay a welcome message and prompt  the user for their name for personalization purposes.
- design of a  welcome message and a change of color between a user and a bot 

# voice_message class
- this class is responseble for playing the voice message  for the user 

### what does it contain
- constructor
- directory location 
- try and catch 
- console appication

### how does it work 
- use a constructore to execute when the object of a class is created.
- this project get the full directory path using the Appdomain and the current domain. 
- Remove the "bin\Debug\" part from the path to get the root project directory to avoid any issues with different file paths during development
- try to play the voice message by Combining the root directory with the file name to get the full path of voice.wav
- it will catch the error exception if the audio has a problem 


# logo_image class
- this class desplay the logo image in ASCII art aftre voice massege 

 ### what does it contains 
- derectore path
- for loop
- console application
 
### how does it work?
- get the full directory path using the Appdomain and the current domain. 
- Remove the "bin\Debug\" part from the path to get the root project directory to avoid any issues with different file paths during development
- combine the root directory path with the image file name to get the full path of the image
- for this class to be able to crate a ASCII image they must be use of Bitmap in a class
- the image is then being resizes to fit the window of a console 
- in this class the for loop is use to Get the color of the current pixel at (width, height),  Convert the color of the pixel to a grayscale value by averaging the RGB components, creates the ASCII representation based on the pixel's grayscale intensity,
- must desplay a clear ASCII image 

# filter_questions class
-- this class allow the user to ask questions related to cybersecurity awerness and it must respond as accurecty as possable 

# what does it contains?
- constructore
- ArrayList  
- while loop 
- if else
- foreach loop
- splitter function 
- filtter function

   - The bot compares filtered user input with stored answers and selects the most relevant response.

4. **Output**:
   - If a match is found, the bot outputs the corresponding response.
   - If no match is found, the bot suggests asking cybersecurity-related questions.
